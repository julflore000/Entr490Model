 ENTR 490 optimization model


Will optimize a energy system given the next x hours under varying decarbonization scenarios

Goal: explore geothermal's role in a decarbonized future in near time

Alternative path: given possible different revenue options with environmental impacts, minimize system costs (can easily reframe to max profit though)
